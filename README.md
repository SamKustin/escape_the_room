## About
This is a dashboard for an Escape the Room game created by the CoRE 
(Computers, Robotics, and Engineering) Learning community at Binghamton 
University. It was used to interactive with players in the room as well as 
provide hints and tell the story of the game.

## Story: 
You are in an intern in Binghamton Unviersity's nuclear powerplant. 
All the senior engineers are on lunch break when you and your team of interns
were trapped inside the control room. Someone has hacked into the systems and 
has shut down all power. You must stop the nuclear powerplant from exploding 
by stabilizing all systems and restoring power to the entire facility. 
Only once all power has been restored may the interns escape from the room. 
The only way to get safely back home is to solve puzzles and manually 
restart the power. Time is running out, you only have 30 minutes.
